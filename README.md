# RPG
RPG-project for practising coding
I am creating my own RPG to practise my coding in a large project on my own.
I will use HTML, CSS with Sass, JavaScript with PIXI and RequireJS.

# Setup
In order to run the project you need to have installed npm and grunt. Run `npm install` to install the required packages.

# Run
Run `grunt` from the terminal in the repo's folder. Then navigate a browser to <localhost:8888>, and you're good to go!
